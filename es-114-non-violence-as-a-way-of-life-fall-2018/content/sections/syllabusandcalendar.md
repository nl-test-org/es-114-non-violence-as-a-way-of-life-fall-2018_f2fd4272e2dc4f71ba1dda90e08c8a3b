Course Description
------------------

Non-violence is more than a political and social strategy. It can be a comprehensive ethical stance. In this course, we examine both the efficacy and ethics of such a stance. We first look at the question of what a non-violent life entails. We read the primary exponents of non-violence, Tolstoy, Gandhi, and King. Next, we investigate the ethical dimensions of non-violence. Can we derive a comprehensive moral theory from the principles of non-violence? Last, we look at specific ethical challenges from the perspective of non-violence. We consider the issues of lying, the duty to forgive, non-violent communication, the ethics of our relationship to anger, the possibility of loving enemies, and the ethics of punishment and rehabilitation.
